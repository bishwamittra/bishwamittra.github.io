abstract = {Social networks with location enabling technologies, also known as geo-social networks,
allow users to share their location-specific activities and preferences through check-ins.
A user in such a geo-social network can be attributed to an associated location (spatial),
her preferences as keywords (textual), and the connectivity (social) with her friends.
The fusion of social, spatial, and textual data of a large number of users in these
networks provide an interesting insight for finding meaningful geo-social groups of
users supporting many real-life applications, including activity planning and recommendation
systems. In this article, we introduce a novel query, namely, Top-k Flexible Socio-Spatial
Keyword-aware Group Query (SSKGQ), which finds the best k groups of varying sizes
around different points of interest (POIs), where the groups are ranked based on the
social and textual cohesiveness among members and spatial closeness with the corresponding
POI and the number of members in the group. We develop an efficient approach to solve
the SSKGQ problem based on our theoretical upper bounds on distance, social connectivity,
and textual similarity. We prove that the SSKGQ problem is NP-Hard and provide an
approximate solution based on our derived relaxed bounds, which run much faster than
the exact approach by sacrificing the group quality slightly. Our extensive experiments
on real data sets show the effectiveness of our approaches in different real-life
settings.},
