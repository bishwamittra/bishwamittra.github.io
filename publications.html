                            Machine learning algorithms that produce rule-based predictions
                                in Conjunctive Normal form (CNF) or in Disjunctive Normal form (DNF)
                                are arguably some of the most interpretable ones. For example,
                                decision set is an interpretable model in practice, that
                                represents the decision function in the form of DNF. 
                                In this paper, we consider relaxed definitions of standard 
                                OR/AND operators which allow exceptions in the construction of 
                                a clause and also in the selection of clauses in a rule. 
                                Building on these relaxed definition, we introduce relaxed-CNF rules, 
                                which are motivated by the popular usage of checklists in 
                                the medical domain and generalizes the widely employed rule 
                                representations including CNF, DNF, and decision sets. While 
                                the combinatorial structure of relaxed-CNF rules offers exponential 
                                succinctness, the naive learning techniques are computationally 
                                expensive. To this end, we propose a novel incremental mini-batch 
                                learning procedure, called CRR, that employs advances in the 
                                Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solvers to efficiently 
                                learn relaxed-CNF rules. Our experimental analysis demonstrates 
                                that CRR can generate relaxed-CNF rules, which are more accurate 
                                and sparser compared to the alternative rule-based models.

                            The success of MaxSAT (maximum satisfiability) solving in recent years has motivated researchers
                                to apply MaxSAT solvers in diverse discrete combinatorial optimization problems. 
                                Group testing has been studied as a combinatorial optimization problem, 
                                where the goal is to find defective items among a set of items by performing sets 
                                of tests on items. In this paper, we propose a MaxSAT-based framework, called MGT, 
                                that solves group testing, in particular, the decoding phase of non-adaptive group 
                                testing. We extend this approach to the noisy variant of group testing, and propose 
                                a compact MaxSAT-based encoding that guarantees an optimal solution. Our extensive 
                                experimental results show that MGT can solve group testing instances of 10000 
                                items with 3% defectivity, which no prior work can handle to the best of our knowledge. 
                                Furthermore, MGT has better accuracy than the LP-based approach. We also discover an 
                                interesting phase transition behavior in the runtime, which reveals the easy-hard-easy 
                                nature of group testing.

                            The wide adoption of machine learning in the critical domains such as medical diagnosis, law, education had propelled the need for interpretable techniques due to the need for end user to understand the reasoning behind decisions due to learning systems. The computational intractability of interpretable learning led practitioners to design heuristic techniques, which fail to provide sound handles to tradeoff accuracy and interpretability.

                            Motivated by the success of MaxSAT solvers over the past decade, recently MaxSAT-based approach, called MLIC, was proposed that seeks to reduce the problem of learning interpretable rules expressed in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) to a MaxSAT query. While MLIC was shown to achieve accuracy similar to that of other state oft he art black-box classifiers while generating small interpretable CNF formulas, the runtime performance of MLIC is significantly lagging and renders approach unusable in practice. In this context, authors raised the question: <i>	Is it possible to achieve the best of both worlds, i.e., a sound framework for interpretable learning that can take advantage of MaxSAT solvers while scaling to real-world instances?					
                            </i></p>

                            In this paper, we take a step towards answering the above question in affirmation. We propose an incremental approach to MaxSAT based framework that achieves scalable runtime performance via partition-based training methodology. Extensive experiments on benchmarks arising from UCI repository demonstrate that IMLI achieves up to three orders of magnitude runtime improvement without loss of accuracy and interpretability.

                                A socio spatial group query finds a group of users who possess strong social connections with each other and have the minimum aggregate spatial distance to a meeting point. Existing studies limit the socio spatial group search to either finding best group of a fixed size for a single meeting location, or a single group of a fixed size w.r.t. multiple meeting locations. However, it is highly desirable to consider multiple meeting locations/POIs in a real-life scenario in order to organize impromptu activities of user groups of various sizes. In this paper, we propose Top k Flexible Socio Spatial Group Query (Top k-FSSGQ) to find and rank the top k groups w.r.t. multiple POIs where each group follows the minimum social connectivity constraints. We devise a ranking function to measure the group score by combining social closeness, spatial distance, and group size, which provides the flexibility of choosing groups of different sizes under different constraints. To effectively process the Top k-FSSGQ, we first develop an Exact approach that ensures early termination of the search based on the derived upper bounds. We prove that the problem is NP-hard, hence we first present a heuristic based approximation algorithm to effectively select members in intermediate solution groups based on the social connectivity of the users. Later we design a Fast Approximate approach based on the relaxed social and spatial bounds, and connectivity constraint heuristic. Experimental studies have verified the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approaches on real datasets.

                                This paper presents LEXR, a framework for explaining the decision making of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) using a formal description language called Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). LTL is the de facto standard for the specification of temporal properties in the context of formal verification and features many desirable properties that make the generated explanations easy for humans to interpret: it is a descriptive language, it has a variable-free syntax, and it can easily be translated into plain English. To generate explanations, LEXR follows the principle of counterexample-guided inductive synthesis and combines Valiant's probably approximately correct learning (PAC) with constraint solving. We prove that LEXR's explanations satisfy the PAC guarantee (provided the RNN can be described by LTL) and show empirically that these explanations are more accurate and easier-to-understand than the ones generated by recent algorithms that extract deterministic finite automata from RNNs.

                            Interpretability has become a central thread in ML research. As ML algorithms continue to permeate critical application domains such as medicine, legal, and transportation, it becomes increasingly important to allow human domain experts to understand and interact with ML solutions. ML algorithms that produce predictions in the form of rules are arguably some of the most interpretable ones, but their discrete combinatorial structure makes them computationally hard to learn. Here we generalize the widely popular CNF rules and introduce relaxed-CNF rules. These rules are much more flexible in terms of fitting data (have higher capacity) but about as interpretable to people as the traditional ones. We consider relaxed definitions of standard OR/AND operators which allow exceptions in the construction of a clause and also in the selection of clauses in a rule. We first describe an exact ILP solution, which is computationally expensive. We then propose an incremental solution, which allows us to generate accurate interpretable relaxed-CNF rules with significantly improved runtime performance.
