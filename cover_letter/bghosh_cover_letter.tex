	\textbf{Subject:} Application for the position of Assistant Professor. 
	
	
	
	\vspace{1em}
	Dear Sir/Madam:
	
	
	
	\vspace{1em}
	Please find my application materials for the position of Assistant Professor at School of Computer Science and Engineering in Nanyang Technological University (NTU).
	
	\vspace{1em}
	My primary areas of interest are  fairness and explainability in machine learning. In my dissertation research, I focus on  fairness verification, sources of unfairness identification, and  explainable rule-based machine learning. In my research, I closely integrate automated reasoning, formal methods, and statistics with fairness and explainability in machine learning for scalable and accurate solutions.
	
	\vspace{1em}
	My research has thrived through multiple collaborations and internships in industry and academia. We have published our works at premier conferences and journals in artificial intelligence and machine learning (AAAI-2022, 2021, 2020, JAIR-2022, ECAI-2020, AIES-2019) and databases (VLDB-2018, TSAS-2022).
	
	\vspace{1em}
	My application materials are also available from my website \blue{\url{https://bishwamittra.github.io}}.
	
	
	\vspace{1em}
	I would be grateful if you would consider my application favorably.\\
	Sincerely yours,
	
	\vspace{1em}
	Bishwamittra Ghosh
