	\paragraph{}
		A key motivation for my pursuing an academic career is the enjoyment I find while teaching and mentoring students. My perspective of teaching is an alternate way to strengthen my understanding of concepts, propagate the joy of learning to young minds, and nurture brainstorming. I am fortunate to have experienced the teaching of great professors and lecturers during my undergraduate and graduate studies. I envision my academic career and teaching experience as a pathway to contribute to the community to whom I am indebted for my knowledge.
	
	\paragraph{Teaching Experience.}
		During my Ph.D. study, I had the opportunity to be a teaching assistant in two courses in NUS. In CS2030: Programming Methodology II, I have developed scripts to grade student's Java codes. The focus was to automate the process of checking certain coding formats, such as class dependencies and Java check-styles. My generated report assists the course lecturer Henry Chia in the gradual improvement of students' coding skills. In another course CS3243: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, I together with fellow graduate students worked on designing course materials for Prof. Kuldeep S. Meel.
