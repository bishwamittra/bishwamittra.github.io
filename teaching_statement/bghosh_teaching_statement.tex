	\paragraph{Overview.}
	A key motivation of me pursuing an academic career is the enjoyment I find while teaching and mentoring students. My perspective of teaching is an alternate way to strengthen my own understanding of concepts, and propagate the joy of learning to young minds and nurture brainstorming. I am fortunate to have experienced the teaching of great professors and lecturers during my undergraduate and graduate studies. I envision my academic career and teaching experience as a pathway to contribute to the  community to whom I am indebted for my knowledge.
